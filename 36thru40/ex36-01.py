# Let's make a game.

# You are a dog. You wake up in the morning
# You have choices. You can pee on the floor, bother your hooman to let you
# out, or go eat breakfast first.

# If you eat breakfast you can decide next if you go to sleep or go to the
# bathroom

# If you go to sleep you wake up just in time for dinner.

# If you go to the bathroom you find yourself outside. You potty. There's a
# piece of old chicken from yesterday's barbecue on the floor. You can choose
# to eat it or ignore it.

# IF you eat the chicken you get an ashy beard and your owner wags their finger
# at you. IF you get a finger wagged at you you can either fall into a deep
# shame or learn from your mistake. Become wiser. You attain enlightenment.

# IF you pee on the floor fingers are wagged. You can either fall into a deep
# shame or learn from your mistake.
